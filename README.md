keyword expansion testing

Some of my (pro and personal) workflows need keywords expansion (Ã  la svn). 

I want to test some solutions here.

## basic method

simply add the actual hash of the commit into $Id: README.md 1.1 $

## rcs/svn behavior

use gaIdke (Automatic GIT Id Keyword Expansion, perl and bash)
